    - A banner is displayed with an input field allowing users to search for specific donation categories.
    - Below the banner, there are four categories displayed, each containing three donation sectors representing as cards (a total of 12 different cards).

1. **Individual Donation Details Page:**
    - Clicking on any donation card on the homepage takes the user to an individual donation details page.
    - On this page, users can see a picture representing the donation, the donation amount, and a description of the donation project.
    - There's an option to click a "Donate" button to contribute to the project.

1. **Toast Notification for Successful Donation:**
    - After clicking the "Donate" button on the individual donation details page, a toast notification appears confirming the successful donation.

    - Each card contains a picture, title, category, price, and a "View Details" button.
    - Clicking the "View Details" button takes users to the individual donation details page for that specific project.
    - The donation page keeps track of and displays the total number of donated projects or cards.

1. **Statistics Page with Donation Percentage Pie Chart:**
    - The statistics page presents a pie chart that visualizes a person's donation percentage based on the total donation number.
    - Users can see their contribution as a percentage compared to the overall number of donations in a graphical representation.
    
1. **Navigation and Routing:**
    - The website uses React Router to navigate between different pages.
    - Users can easily switch between the home, donation, and statistics pages using the navigation bar.
    - The routing system ensures a smooth and user-friendly experience while exploring and interacting with the website.

These features combine to create a comprehensive donation campaign website that allows users to explore donation projects, contribute to them, track their contributions, and visualize their impact through statistics.
